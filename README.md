# MICE2_mocks

This Repository provides code to create galaxy mock catalogues based on
[MICE](http://maia.ice.cat/mice/) galaxy catalogues.


## Requirements

The pipeline is written in Python3 and requires the following non-standard
packages:
- `numpy` and `scipy`
- `astropy>=3.0` (recommended for the improved astropy.table performance)
- `matplotlib>=2.0` for the plotting scripts

> Currently the code also depends on a wrapper for the STOMP library. A python3
version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jlvdb/astro-stomp3) and
installed following
[these](https://github.com/morriscb/the-wizz/wiki/Stomp-Installation)
instructions.

Additionally, the wrapper scripts in `./KV450` and `./DES` make use of
external packages that provide convenience functions to handling data table
files and STOMP pixel maps:
- [jlvdb/table_tools](https://github.com/jlvdb/table_tools) (script calls
starting with `data_table_`)
- [jlvdb/stomp_tools](https://github.com/jlvdb/stomp_tools) (script calls
starting with `stomp_`)

To be able to compute photometric redshifts
[BPZ](http://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/) is requried.


## Instructions

Starting from the MICE2 base catalogues, the pipeline allows to model various
observational selection functions:

- Spectroscopic surveys: GAMA, SDSS (main sample, BOSS and QSOs), 2dFLenS,
WiggleZ, DEEP2, zCOSMOS and VVDS (2h field)
- Photometric surveys: Examples to create 450 sqdeg of KiDS-VIKING (KV450,
`./KV450`) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES, `./DES`) are included.

The pipeline allows to attach realistic photometry realisations to the MICE2
catalogues, photometric redshifts, galaxy weights, and spectroscopic success
rates for some of the included spectroscopic selection functions.


### Data Access

The MICE2 base catalogues can be downloaded from
[COSMO HUB](https://cosmohub.pic.es/). Recommended column selections (in SQL
query stile using 'expert mode') for KV450 are

```
SELECT
    `unique_gal_id`, `ra_gal`, `dec_gal`, `z_cgal`, `z_cgal_v`,
    `sdss_u_true`, `lephare_b_true`, `sdss_g_true`,
    `lephare_v_true`, `sdss_r_true`, `lephare_rc_true`,
    `sdss_i_true`, `lephare_ic_true`, `sdss_z_true`,
    `des_asahi_full_y_true`, `vhs_j_true`,
    `vhs_h_true`, `vhs_ks_true`,
    `bulge_fraction`, `bulge_length`, `bulge_axis_ratio`,
    `disk_length`, `disk_axis_ratio`
FROM micecatv2_0_view WHERE `dec_gal` <= 30 AND `ra_gal` >= 30 AND `ra_gal` <= 60
```
where `des_asahi_full_y_true` is the best match for the VISTA (`vhs_*_true`)
_Y_-band that is missing in MICE2. The VST _ugriz_-bands are covered by
`sdss_*_true`.

For DES we can select
```
SELECT
    `unique_gal_id`, `ra_gal`, `dec_gal`, `z_cgal`, `z_cgal_v`,
    `sdss_u_true`, `lephare_b_true`, `sdss_g_true`,
    `lephare_v_true`, `sdss_r_true`, `lephare_rc_true`,
    `sdss_i_true`, `lephare_ic_true`, `sdss_z_true`,
    `des_asahi_full_y_true`, `vhs_j_true`,
    `vhs_h_true`, `vhs_ks_true`,
    `bulge_fraction`, `bulge_length`, `bulge_axis_ratio`,
    `disk_length`, `disk_axis_ratio`
FROM micecatv2_0_view WHERE `dec_gal` <= 30 AND `ra_gal` >= 30 AND `ra_gal` <= 60
```
correspondingly and make use of the fact that MICE2 comes by default with all
DES model magnitudes.

This selection uses the most complete patch of MICE (`30 <= RA <= 60` and
`0 <= DEC <= 30`). Some of these columns are only needed to additionaly select
spectoscopic samples.


### Creating Photometric Catalogues

The wrapper scripts in `./KV450` and `./DES` show exemplary how to create
mock catalogues matched to observational data. These steps include:

1. Applying the MICE2 evolution correction.
2. Correcting the model magnitudes for magnification.
3. Computing observational galaxy sizes based on the point spread function
(this allows a size contribution to the photometric uncertainties).
4. Adding a photometry realization based on the observational limiting
magnitudes
5. Assigning galaxy weights by nearest neighbour matching between mock and data
in magnitude space
6. Computing photometric redshifts with BPZ


### Creating Spectroscopic Catalogues

The pipeline bundles a variety of spectroscopic (target) selection functions:
- 2dFLenS (Blake et al. 2016)
- DEEP2 (Newman et al. 2013)
- GAMA (Driver et al. 2011)
- SDSS
  - main sample (Strauss et al. 2002)
  - BOSS (Dawson et al. 2013)
  - QSO sample (Schneider et al. 2010a, only attempting to match the redshift 
    distribution)
- WiggleZ (Drinkwater et al. 2010, missing UV information replaced by redshift 
  distribution matching)
- VVDS (LeFÃ¨vre et al. 2005, only 2h field)
- zCOSMOS (Lilly et al. 2009, only bright sample)

These selection functions are defined in `./pipeline/specz_selection.py` and
have some adjustments applied in order to give a better match to the data
colour and/or redshift distributions.

There are wrapper scripts in `./KV450` and `./DES` that produce photometry
and/or line of sight realisations of the deep spectroscopic catalouges (DEEP2,
VVDS and zCOSMOS) as they are used e.g. in Wright et al. (2019) for tests of
the SOM DIR redshift calibration method.
